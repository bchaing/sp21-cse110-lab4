### Part 1a
1. values added: 20
2. final result:  20
3. values added: 20
4. error, result is not defined in this scope
5. error, result can't be reassigned after the first time
6. error, result is node defined in this scope and can't be reassigned

### Part 1b
1. "3" will be printed
2. "150" will be printed
3. "150" will be printed
4. [50, 100, 150] This function returns an array of each number in the price array subtracted by the discounted amount.
5. Error, i is only defined in the scope of the for loop.
6. Error, discountedPrice is only defined in the scope of the for loop.
7. "150" will be printed
8. [50, 100, 150] This function returns an array of each number in the price array subtracted by the discounted amount.
9. Error, i is not defined outside of the for loop.
10. "3" will be printed as this is the length of the prices array.
11. [ 50, 100, 150 ] The function takes each element in the array and gets the discounted amount, pushing this to a return array.
12. A. student.name \
    B. student['Grad Year'] \
    C. student.greeting() \
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'] \
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. 32, integers map to their exact string representation\
    B. 1, strings map to their integer representations\
    C. 3, null maps to 0\
    D. 3null, the string representation of null is "null"\
    E. 4, true maps to 1\
    F. 0, false and null map to 0\
    G. 3undefined, undefined maps to the string "undefined"\
    H. NaN, a integer can't be subtracted by undefined\
14. A. true, strings map to their integer represtnations\
    B. false, strings are compared in "lexicographical" order\
    C. true, integers map to their exact string representation\
    D. false, the === operator checks for strict equality, so types must be the same \
    E. false, true maps to 1 which is not equal to 2\
    F. true, 2 maps to a true boolean and they are the same type
15. The == checks for equality with type conversion, meaning that operands of different types can still equal each other if one of their conversions is equal. The === is strict equality, meaning that the type of the operands must be equal along with the equality of the operands.
16. 
17. [2,4,6]. The modifyArray function interates through each element of the array parameter. For each loop, the callback function is called on the current element of the array, returning the element times 2. This is then pushed to the return array.
